# 基本指令及文件

`/etc` configuration files

`/var` varing files

`/dev` devices files

`/proc` system information files

`which` command

`ls -l` = `ll`

**<Middle Mouse>** paste selected text

**<ctrl-c>** stop current command

**<ctrl-z>** suspend current command

**<ctrl-d>** send “end of file” to application

`clear` 清空

`exit` 退出 terminal

`file <filename>` identify file type

`mv <oldname> <newname>` rename

`cp [-r] <filename> <newname>` copy, directories when -r

`touch filename` create empty file

Wildcard (placeholder) characters (globbing):

- `*` zero or more characters
- `?` exactly one character
- `[]` range of characters

`find <targetdir> <options>` searching for files

`find . -name "ex1.txt" -type f`

`command > filename` redirected stdout

`command 2> filename` redirected stderr

`command < filename` redirected stdin

`command1 | command2` use output of one command as input to another: pipe symbol

`command >> filename` append file with overwriting

**Text Display:**

- `cat` outputs contents of a text file to console
- `less` going back and forth/ used by man pages
- `head`  display first lines
- `tail` display last lines

**Searching file contents:**

- `grep <options> <string> <filename>`
- example: `grep -i -r "test" example*.txt`
- command options:
    - `-r` Recursive
    - `-i` Ignore upper/lower case
    - `-I` Ignore binary files (capital i)

**Modify permissions:**

`chmod u+x <filename>`

`u`=user, `g`=group, `o`=other, `a`=All

`r`=Read `w`=Write `x`=execute

**Checking processes:**

`top` for short overview: `pstree`

navigate `top`:

`u`: filter processes from a specific user

`k`: kill a specific process

`h`: show help

`f`: toggle displayed columns

`x`: highlight current sort column

`<>`: select column to sort for 

`R`:Reverse sorting

`Q`: quit top

**Background**

`<command> &` background starting (good if command launches **window**, console still usable)

`bg` to show background commands

`fg <Job-ID>` bring certain job to foreground 

**Environment Modules**

switch environments, avoiding collision of environment variables

- Example:
    
    `module load openmpi/gcc/64/1.10.3`
    
- Each module has a definition file (LUA or Tcl script)
- Constraints at least 3 things
    - Description what module does
    - Prepend to path and other variables
    - Add new variables
- Path Variable
    - seperated by `:`
    - always add new directories in front of the `$PATH`
    

**System Configuration**

- System information files:
    - `/proc/cpuinfo`
    - `/proc/meminfo`
- Aliases
    - For long commands
    - example
        - `alias ll=’ls -l’`
        - `alias cd..='cd ..'`
- Configuration Files
    - `~/.bashrc, ~/.bash_profile` are read when console is started
    - other files like `~/.vimrc`
    - `source <filename>`
- `locale`

**Useful commands**

- `du -sch .`
    - show disc usage
    - opposite `df`
- `history`
    - list previous commands
    - `history | grep <commandname>`
- `ln -s`
    - symbolic link
- `watch`
    - `watch tail mylog.txt` show waht is written to a log file
- `$(())`
    - simple integermath
    - `$(( 5 + 3 ))`
- `sed`
    - simple text operations
    - `sed -i "s/old/new/g" example.txt`
        - `-i` edit in place
        - `s` replace
        - `g` all occurrences

# Examples
## Apps running background

Running an application in the background on a Linux system and logging its output to a file involves a couple of straightforward steps. This can be particularly useful for long-running processes or when you want to capture the output for later review.

Here's a basic approach to achieve this:

### 1. Running the App in the Background

You can use the `&` symbol at the end of a command to run an application in the background. For example:

```bash
myapp &
```

This command starts `myapp` and runs it in the background, allowing you to continue using the terminal.

### 2. Redirecting Output to a Log File

To capture the output of the application, you can redirect it to a file using the `>` (for overwriting) or `>>` (for appending) operators. For example:

```bash
myapp > myapp.log &
```

This command will redirect the standard output (stdout) of `myapp` to a file named `myapp.log`. If you also want to capture the standard error (stderr), you can do so by adding `2>&1`:

```bash
myapp > myapp.log 2>&1 &
```

### 3. Using `nohup` for Persistent Background Processes

If you want the application to continue running even after you log out of the shell, you can use the `nohup` command, which stands for "no hangup":

```bash
nohup myapp > myapp.log 2>&1 &
```

This command will prevent `myapp` from being terminated when the session ends. The `nohup` command also automatically redirects the output, so you don't necessarily need to redirect stdout and stderr, although doing so explicitly as shown above is a good practice.

### 4. Checking Background Processes

You can see a list of your background processes with the `jobs` command. To bring a background process to the foreground, use `fg`, possibly followed by the job number, which you can see in the output of `jobs`.

### 5. Viewing the Log

You can view the contents of the log file at any time with a text viewer or editor, like `cat`, `less`, or `nano`:

```bash
cat myapp.log
```

Or to continuously monitor new additions to the log:

```bash
tail -f myapp.log
```

### Notes

- Be aware of the file size of the log, especially for long-running processes, as it can grow significantly over time.
- Always test your command to ensure it works as expected in your specific environment and for your specific application.
- If your application requires interaction, running it in the background might not be suitable, as it won't be able to receive input from the terminal.
