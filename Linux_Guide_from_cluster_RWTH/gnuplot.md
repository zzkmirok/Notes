# Gnuplot #
Gnuplot is a powerful command-line tool for creating 2D and 3D plots and graphs. It's commonly used for data visualization in scientific and engineering applications. Here are some basic Gnuplot commands and concepts to get you started:

1. **Launching Gnuplot**:
   To start Gnuplot, open your terminal and simply type `gnuplot`. This will launch the Gnuplot interactive console.

2. **Basic Plotting**:
   You can create basic 2D plots using the `plot` command. For example:

   ```gnuplot
   plot "data.txt" using 1:2 with lines
   ```

   This command plots data from the file "data.txt," using the first column for the x-axis and the second column for the y-axis, with lines connecting the data points.

3. **Setting Labels**:
   You can label your axes and the plot itself using `set` commands:

   ```gnuplot
   set xlabel "X-Axis Label"
   set ylabel "Y-Axis Label"
   set title "Plot Title"
   ```

4. **Changing Line Styles**:
   You can customize the line styles and colors using `with`:

   ```gnuplot
   plot "data.txt" using 1:2 with linespoints lc rgb "blue" lw 2
   ```

   This command plots data with blue lines and points, with a line width of 2.

5. **Multiple Data Sets**:
   You can plot multiple data sets on the same graph:

   ```gnuplot
   plot "data1.txt" using 1:2 with lines, "data2.txt" using 1:2 with points
   ```

   This plots data from two files with different styles on the same graph.

6. **Plotting Functions**:
   Gnuplot allows you to plot mathematical functions as well:

   ```gnuplot
   plot sin(x), cos(x)
   ```

   This plots the sine and cosine functions.

7. **Saving Plots**:
   To save your plot to an image file, you can use the `set terminal` and `set output` commands:

   ```gnuplot
   set terminal png
   set output "plot.png"
   plot "data.txt" using 1:2 with lines
   ```

   This will save the plot as "plot.png" in PNG format.

8. **3D Plotting**:
   Gnuplot can also create 3D plots using the `splot` command. For example:

   ```gnuplot
   splot "data.txt" using 1:2:3 with points
   ```

   This plots a 3D scatter plot using data from "data.txt."

9. **Customizing Appearance**:
   Gnuplot offers extensive customization options. You can change line styles, colors, point types, and more. Refer to the Gnuplot documentation for details.

10. **Scripting**:
    You can create Gnuplot scripts by saving your commands in a text file (e.g., "myscript.gp") and then running Gnuplot with `gnuplot myscript.gp`.

These are just the basics of Gnuplot. It's a very versatile tool with many advanced features for data visualization. You can explore its capabilities further by referring to the official documentation and examples.

## Examples ##

### `p 'colvar_1.dat' ev 10 u 2:3 w p, f(x)-20` ###

The Gnuplot command `p 'colvar_1.dat' ev 10 u 2:3 w p, f(x)-20` is used to create a plot based on data from the file 'colvar_1.dat' and a mathematical function.

Here's what each part of the command means:

1. `p 'colvar_1.dat'`: This part specifies that you want to create a plot using data from the file 'colvar_1.dat'. The 'p' stands for "plot."

2. `ev 10`: This part of the command uses the 'ev' keyword, which means "every." It indicates that you want to select every 10th data point from the input data file for plotting. This can be useful when you have a large dataset, and you want to reduce the number of points plotted for clarity.

3. `u 2:3`: This part specifies how to use the columns from the data file. In this case, it tells Gnuplot to use column 2 as the x-values and column 3 as the y-values for plotting.

4. `w p`: This part specifies that you want to plot the data points as individual points ('p' stands for "points"). Each data point will be represented as a point marker on the plot.

5. `f(x)-20`: This part introduces a mathematical function into the plot. Specifically, it subtracts 20 from the function f(x). The 'f(x)' represents a mathematical expression involving the variable 'x.' You need to define the function 'f(x)' elsewhere in your Gnuplot script or session. The result of this expression will be plotted along with the data points.

So, the overall effect of this Gnuplot command is to plot every 10th data point from 'colvar_1.dat' using columns 2 and 3 as the x and y values, respectively, and also plot the function f(x)-20 on the same graph. The data points will be represented as individual points, and the function will be adjusted by subtracting 20 from its values before plotting.

### `stat 'ch3f-1.ener' u 7` ###
The Gnuplot command `stat 'ch3f-1.ener' u 7` is used to obtain statistics for a specific column (column 7 in this case) of data from the file 'ch3f-1.ener.' Here's what each part of the command means:

- `stat`: This is the Gnuplot command that is used to compute statistics.

- `'ch3f-1.ener'`: This is the name of the data file you want to analyze. Make sure the file 'ch3f-1.ener' is in the current directory or provide the full path if it's located elsewhere.

- `u 7`: This part specifies that you want to compute statistics on column 7 of the data file. The 'u' stands for "using."

When you run this Gnuplot command, it will calculate various statistics for the data in column 7 of the file 'ch3f-1.ener,' such as the minimum, maximum, mean, standard deviation, and more, and it will display these statistics in the Gnuplot terminal. These statistics can be helpful for understanding the distribution and characteristics of the data in the specified column.


### ` set xrange[-2:2]; set yrange[-0.5:2]` ###

### `do for [i=1:30] { plot 'COLVAR_'.i using 1:2; pause 0.5 }` ###
To achieve this in gnuplot, you can use a one-liner command that loops through your files and plots them as a live animation. Here's the command:

```bash
gnuplot -e "do for [i=1:30] { plot 'COLVAR_'.i using 1:2; pause 0.5 }"
```

This command does the following:
- Launches gnuplot.
- Uses a `do for` loop to iterate over the files from `COLVAR_1` to `COLVAR_30`.
- For each file `i`, it plots the data using the first and second columns (you can adjust the `using 1:2` part if your data is structured differently).
- Pauses for 0.5 seconds (`pause 0.5`) after each plot to create an animation effect. You can adjust this duration to speed up or slow down the animation.

Ensure that your `COLVAR_i` files are in the correct format for gnuplot and that they are accessible from the directory where you run this command.
