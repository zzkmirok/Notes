# Ab-initio Quantum Electrodynamics
Norah M. Hoffmann NYU
## Take-away for myself
- Wigner-Weyl transformation to classical phase space.

## light-matter interactions
Material + Light (Light as an active member of reactions)

### Different complexity of matter and light
Note: E(r,t) --> B(r,t) --> E-Magnetic waves -->Light

**Vacuum-field fluctuation** (A very typical model for quantum description of light)

Propagate Quantum Infomatics


## Quantum Computing Overview

QuBit Superposition for complexity

QuBit Entanglement for transporting Info

How to solve 2 main problems of quantum computing

- Interference instead of measuring (Solve System Collapse)

- Cooling of the system (Avoid interactions with env)
    - a main problem of Quantum Computing is the application of Room Temperature QC

> **Photon Computing**


## Benchmark and Implementation
### Systems of Interest
Nat. phys. 18 1191 (2022) : a System with Cavities (didn't follow the name)

> In Hamitonian Light-Material Coupling terms

### Sampling Schemes (transformation of the system): cMTE

**Wigner Sampling** (Wave fun <--> classical with no uncertainty principle)    : Reproduce QM dynamics to Semi-classical

Wigner-Weyl transformation

> Note: Ground States works well, not Excited states (negative distribution in phase (q-p) space)

### Propagate system classically
Ehrenfest Dynamics
---> Cavity Multi-Trajectory Ehrenfest

### Quantum Light Spontaneous Emission

### Quick Detour: Exact Factorization
Highly anharmonic features for Harmonic Potential on Photon

## Q&A

- Bypassing problems with sampling excited state

    What is Coherence state? (seems also a tool to do a classical transform)
